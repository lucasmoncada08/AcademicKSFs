","My notes (if it wasn't a crime to share them). They are way better than the profs. Lakehead university professors really don't care about their undergraduates and their notes suck (hanging titles, tons of mistakes, very hard to read due to poor formatting choices, its like they just through something together and said good enough). If people started off with good notes, they would be able to spend time learning the material rather than deciphering the notes. I get that this doesn't take some people as long but its horrible when you finally get through the notes and have zero time to practice because of the lack of effort of your teachers. 
Also old exam problems would be wonderful. Lakehead says that they give out old exams but if you look, its up to the profs discretion, which means for engineering they are only sometimes there, and not even with the same prof. The wording sometimes is very unclear so it would be great to understand what the question is asking and actually be able to study rather than ""just figure it out"" like the profs magically want you to.  ","Please please make it mandatory for profs to give the notes to students. We are paying for it and I am not fast enough to take down notes. I have accommodations which means that I can get the notes afterwards from my classmates, but I would love to be able to read ahead to get some comprehension and have the notes there in front of me so that I can keep up in class. Right now I am always playing catch up and it really sucks. I do like 12+ hours of homework every day because the profs don't allow me to keep up in class and I am always behind which means I end up just learning all the material on my own out of textbooks anyways. If I had the opportunity to learn at my own pace before class, I would maybe actually get something out of it rather than feeling like my time has been wasted. "

However I have also taken many courses that have roughly 1-3 test and an exam worth 50% or greater and I would  likely not be able to solve any problem distinct to that course even if I completed the course with a 80%+ grade. These extremely high weighted exams which are often bogged down by location, lack of resources and time limits, often fail completely to represent 4 months of practice and learning. Very few of my professors have ever done a in depth project in substitute for a final exam(accreditation requires this for some reason, and what often seems to be laziness when it comes to grading). The few courses that did do an in-depth project for a final I will likely never forget. Not to mention the extremely outdated practice of hand writing computer code on a test paper(done this half a dozen times with varying success and it has never been a good representation of the course material). Thank you for listening to my TED talk,
